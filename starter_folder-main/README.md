# Trends and Patterns in Bicycle Thefts: A Temporal Analysis of Incident Data

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a study on bicycle theft patterns using data from OpenDataToronto. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations to uncover insights about theft frequency, location hotspots, and the relationship between bike value and recovery rates.

Some of the R code used to create this work was adapted from Alexander (2023).


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from data.
-   `data/cleaned_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, ChatGPT 4.0. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatGPT 4.0 and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
